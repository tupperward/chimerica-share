# Helm - Deity
## Overview
Helm was the god of guardians and protectors, worshiped by guards and paladins both. The Vigilant One had long been seen as a cold and focused deity who impartially took the role of defender, and sometimes enforcer, but his activities in the Time of Troubles caused the folk of the world to view him differently. The Watcher was the epitome of the vigilant guardian and embodiment of the spirit of watchfulness, whether used for good or ill.

Far back in time, the deity Lathander caused a divine purge known as the Dawn Cataclysm in which Helm's lover, a lesser deity of pragmatism called Murdane, was a victim. Helm begrudged the Morninglord for this. However, Helm reserved his real opposition for deities whose plots threatened the people and stability of Faerûn, especially Bane, Cyric, Mask, and Shar. He was also especially at odds with the uncontrolled violence and careless destruction of the deities Garagos, Malar, and Talos.

The only god who could have been considered a full ally of the Watcher was Torm, the god of paladins. Strongly held ideological differences caused a great rivalry verging on hatred between the clergy of the two gods, but the deities themselves remained close.

A forbidding guardian of unknown name or nature in mithral full plate manned Everwatch, unfailingly detecting alignments and the purposes of visitors.

## Worshipers

Prior to the Time of Troubles, Helmites were long respected and revered for their dedication and purpose, especially in the frontiers of the North. Throughout the divine crisis, and beyond, they unfailingly pledged to come to the defense of those who called for it.

They wore polished full suits of armor, often enchanted as everbright,and typically wore plumed helmets. Their hierarchy was strict and militaristic, with specific groups such as the order of paladins called the Vigilant Eyes of the God, and originally also a single pontiff as head of the church—the Supreme Watcher. 

### Festivals 

Helmites celebrated the festival known as the Ceremony of Honor to Helm on Shieldmeet.
