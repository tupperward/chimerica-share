Eox is a desolate, barren region that has been ravaged by war and necromancy. Its surface is scarred with deep craters and jagged mountains made of black rock. The region's atmosphere is thin and toxic, making it impossible for most living creatures to survive without the aid of technology or magic. The majority of the population on Eox are undead creatures, ruled over by powerful necromancers who control the region from their stronghold in The Pits.
