## Geography
Drak Moria is located deep within the Mountains of West Virginia, accessible only by a network of mines and tunnels. The city is divided into districts, each with its own unique architecture and design. The central district, which is home to the Iron Throne and the council of clan leaders, is known as Stoneheart. Other notable districts include Blackrock, which is home to Drak Moria's blacksmiths and forges, and Crystal Caverns, where rare gems are mined.

## History
Drak Moria was founded over a thousand years ago by a group of dwarves who had been driven out of their homeland by orc invasions. They discovered the vast network of mines and tunnels deep within the Mountains of West Virginia and began to build their new home there. Over time, more dwarves arrived from other parts of the world to join them in Drak Moria, bringing with them new skills and trades. The city grew into a thriving underground metropolis that became renowned throughout the world for its craftsmanship and wealth.

The history of Drak Moria has not been without conflict. The city has been attacked numerous times over the centuries by goblin and orc tribes who seek to plunder its riches. Each time, however, the dwarves have managed to repel their attackers thanks to their superior combat skills and knowledge of the mountain terrain.

## Culture
Dwarven culture is deeply ingrained in every aspect of life in Drak Moria. Clan loyalty is paramount, with each district controlled by a different clan who pledge allegiance to the Mountain King. Dwarves from this region place great importance on honor and reputation; they are known for being stubborn but also fiercely loyal to their friends and allies.

Craftsmanship is also highly valued in Drak Moria; it is said that every dwarf has at least one trade skill that they have mastered. Blacksmithing is especially important, as Drak Moria is known for producing some of the finest weapons and armor in the world. The city's temples are dedicated to Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, but other dwarven gods are also revered.

Despite their underground isolation, dwarves from Drak Moria are not opposed to adventure. Many have ventured beyond the city's borders to explore the world and seek out new business opportunities. However, they always return home to their beloved city in the mountains.

## Politics
**Government:** Feudalism - Ruled by a council of clan leaders under the authority of the Mountain King.

Drak Moria operates under a feudal system, with each district controlled by a different clan who pledge loyalty to the Mountain King. The council of clan leaders, led by the Mountain King, make decisions on behalf of the city as a whole. The council is responsible for making laws and enforcing them, as well as managing the city's resources and infrastructure.

The Mountain King holds ultimate authority over Drak Moria and is responsible for maintaining order and defending the city from external threats. The title of Mountain King is hereditary, passed down through generations of dwarven rulers. The current Mountain King is Drogan Stonefist, who has ruled over Drak Moria for over three decades.

Under the feudal system, each clan is responsible for governing their own district and ensuring its prosperity. Clan leaders have significant power within their districts, but must still answer to the council of clan leaders and the Mountain King. Disputes between clans are settled through negotiation or sometimes trial by combat.

Overall, Drak Moria's feudal system has served it well over its long history. While there have been occasional power struggles between clans or with outside forces, the stability provided by the central government has allowed Drak Moria to thrive and become one of the wealthiest and most powerful underground cities in the world.
