# Valenar
## Overview
**Type**: Ethnic
**Ethnic Identity**: Homeland, Ancestry

The elves of Valenar venerate the memories of their warrior ancestors, the giant slayers of ancient Xen'drik. Where the elves of Aerenal honor their ancestors through devotion and prayer, the Valaes Tairn believe that imitation is the truest form of flattery. Heroic deeds and glory in battle are the two goals of the Valaes Tairn, and their society revolves around this principle. The primary social unit of the elves if the clan or war clan, a group of two hundred to five hundred elves, subdivided into smaller war bands of 8 to 12 individuals each. Unless assigned a guard area, a war clan stays in constant motion. The Valenar elves are interested in expanding their territory but are more interested in battle than land. 

A member of the Valaes Tairn values his horse and his patron ancestor above all things. Determined at birth by the clerics of the Valaes Tairn, the spirit of a patron ancestor watches over the warrior, and the elf does everything in his power to emulate and honor his patron. The Valenar elves have a taste for art,music and dance, but everything revolves around war. Their fine weapons and delicate armor are their works of art, and their songs recount the great deeds of the elf warriors of Xen'drik. 

Non-elves still live in Valenar. Once peasants under another ruler, these people simple swapped overlords. The elves have very little interest in agriculture, so instead take tribute from these permanent settlements in exchange for protection. While this would normally seem like a protection racket, the elves are always true to their word, eager to recreate their ancestor's glory.

## Government of the Valaes Tairn
The Valaes Tairn consists of a league of individual war clans, not an organized legion. All Valenar elves owe fealty to the high king. Forty-five warclans roam Valenar. At any time, twenty of the warclans - The Host of Valenar - are under the direct command of the high king. Ten of these maintain order throughout the realm, while the rest engage in military operations dictated by the crown. A warclan's service in the Host of Valenar lasts for ten years, after which a new warclan takes its place. 

The other warclans are free to conduct military operations and raids as they see fit, though the high king can call upon them as he deems necessary. Many young elves leave Valenar for a decade or so in search of personal glory or adventure. 

A warrior who performs a service for the high king may receive a title and a tract of land. However, the elves prefer to remain in constant motion, a few lords maintain a manor or  keep. 

## Major Settlements 
**Taer Valaestas (Large City -18,400)**
The Valaes Tairn have little love for cities, but every kingdom needs a throne and High King Vidalia has his seat in Taer Valaestas. Located in the center of Valenar, Taer Valaestas is a city built for war. Towers and walls built of stone and densewood are designed to resist fire and force. 
## Philosophy
The Valenar elves share the religious beliefs of the elves of Aerenal, but with a slightly different focus. They respect the councilors of the Undying Court, but have greater reverence for the elven hereoes of Xen'drik. Each warrior has a patron ancestor and seeks to emulate their ancestor through deeds that let the ancestor live again, after a fashion.

## Organizations
**The Keepers of the Past**
The de facto priesthood of the Valenar elves, the Keepers of the Past are the rare individuals who can directly commune with the patron spirits guiding each elf. The Keepers hold immense power; if they turned against the high king, many elves would take their side.
