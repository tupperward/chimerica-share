# Rowan-Oak
## Overview
**Community Size**: Outpost
**Alignment**: Neutral Evil
**Government**: Appointed Governor 
**Defense**: Private Union Company garrison
**Commerce**: Flax oil export

## Description
**Population**: ~120

A massive tree hollow a mile in diameter serves as natural defenses for a small frontier town. Stone and wood buildings huddle in close to the ancient wooden walls. A young Rowan-Oak sapling grows prominently in the lawn of the governor's palace, a symbol of the colonial government's willingness to co-operate with the local elves whose traditional land they are occupying. Settlers have taken to growing flax in the large clearing around them and processing it into flax oil, giving the whole town a pervading rancid stink.
