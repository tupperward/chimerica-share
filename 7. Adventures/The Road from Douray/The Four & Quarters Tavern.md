Tables and chairs are all pushed towards the walls leaving space for a polished dance floor in the center. The tavern keeper dutifuly wipes glasses and starts preparing food for lunchtime while watching his three children play with their toys or dance around on the polished floor. A stream of local children trickles in and out, and Reggie greets each one as they come in. 

"Hey there, Susanna! How's the new tooth? Jarnathan, I like the haircut!"
