# The Impregnable Fortress of Dib
## Introduction
```ad-quote
We were traveling the old trade road up near the Blind Hills when we found it: an overturned wagon in the ditch. Evas took to the shadows, scouted ahead, and returned with strange details. The wagon had been transformed—such that it appeared to be a fierce fortress. Signs of goblin-work were apparent: broken shields reinforcing the walls, crude arrow slits cut into the driver’s bench, a makeshift flag hanging limply atop the whole affair. We let it alone, but even at a distance the smell of the odd fortress’s unfinished moat made us wretch . . .
```
### Background 
Several months back, [[Dib Halfling-Chewer]] and his cronies were
ejected from a nearby goblin clan for indiscriminate wrestling.
heir antics, though hilariously entertaining to themselves, were
destructive and dangerous to the rest of the clan. he goblins
spent several nights in the wilderness before discovering an
__abandoned wagon__ by the side of a trade road. here, the homeless
cadre transformed the wagon into a distinctly goblinoid fortress.
hey have had some success in assaulting and looting travelers on
the road.

```ad-abstract
title: Abandoned Wagon 
This wagon was raided by Garden partisans and left as a roadblock. Dib and his crew of wrestlers discovered it and muscled it into its current position on the side of the road. 
```

```

## Adventure Element B: The Fortress Defends - 30 XP
Adventurers can defeat the fortress in a number of ways. 

```ad-inline-attack 
title: "Kill" It
The fortress has an AC of 14 and 40 hit points. It is resistant to piercing damage and weak to fire. _(See "Fire" below)_. PCs may attack it as they would a normal albeit immobile target. Once the fortress reaches 0 hp, the goblinds retreat to area 3.
```
```ad-danger
title: Kicking In the Door
The door at the back of the wagon is solidly reinforced. Forcing the door requires a DC 15 Athletics check. The check is reduced to 12 if the wagon is at half HP or less. Once the door is forced, the goblins retreat to Area 3
```
```ad-caution
title: Lifting the Whole Damn Thing Up
Lifting and tipping the fortress over takes 2 rounds. Each round rquires a successful DC 17 Athletics check as a full round action made by one PC. The DC of this check is reduced by 1 for each PC assisting. PCs involved in lifting the wagon may take no other actions this turn.
```
```ad-tip
title: Fire 
If the wagon takes fire damage, it has a 50 percent chace to burst into flames. While aflame, the wagon takes 9 (2d6+2) damage per round on initiative 20. If the wagon takes 24 or more damage from eing on fire, the goblins retreat to Area 3.
```
## Adventure Element C: Wrestling Moves - 80 XP
The goblins inside the fortress gain +2 on all grappling related checks and attacks. The goblins get +2 on all [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Actions/grapple|grapple]] related checks. When forced into melee combat, they are as likely to attempt grabs and shoves as they are [[shortsword]]  attacks. Dib, a regular goblin in every other way, gains the following:

```ad-inline-attack
title: Knee-Bar
Melee [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Actions/grapple|grapple]] attack. +4 to hit. 3 bludgeoning damage. Dib can maintain the [knee bar](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fattacktheback.b-cdn.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FKneebar_2-Neil_Melanson_Seminar_March_2012.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=583eb01e87563754a4a4b7f088d466f9911b464315762b7561b18cd900e85465&ipo=images) indefinitely, but can take no move actions and is considered prone while doing so.
```
## Map
![[Pasted image 20230708022619.png]]


## Area 1
```ad-quote
title: Exterior
A large wooden wagon has been oerturned a few feet from the road. An incomplete moat rings the structure, the vapors from its gelatinous contents reach your nose even at fifty paces. The wagon has been reinforced with broken shields and scavanged planks, an unforunate fox has been nailed unceremoniously atop a crude doorway. Slits and holes of various sizes have been bored and carved into the walls, and you hear whispering and rustling coming from within. A flag made from cloth scraps hangs unmoving in the still air.
```

The goblins do not leave the safety of their wagon willingly. They are interested in softer targets than a band of adventurers, and so they stay under the wagon and operate its attacks as previously described. In general, if the wagon seems likely to be destroyed, the goblins retreat to Area 3
## Area 2
```ad-quote
title: Under the Wagon 
The inside of the makeshift stronghold is a dank and foul-smelling place. A small cauldron of rendered animal fat boils over a smoky fire. Several poorly crafted spears sit abandoned on the ground. A ladder suggests the wagon's inhabitants have dug into the ground below. 
```

Once their fortress is breached, the four goblins retreat belowground to Area 3.

## Area 3 
```ad-quote
title: Tunnel and Throne Room 
The tunnel, precariously carved and shored up with planking, runs straight for 30 ft, before turning sharply. Around the corner are the goblins' living quarters. A single sputtering torch illuminates the small chamber and the makeshift throne at the far end. Evil eys blink from behind four small mounds of dirt and bedding. The sound of bow strings being drawn greets your ears.
```

The goblins make ranged attacks from behind half cover until forced into melee. At the entrance to the chamber is a simple spike trap. 
```ad-warning
title: Spike Trap!
Noticing the trap requires a **DC 12 Perception check**.
Disarming the trap requires a **DC 12 Thievery check.**
```
```ad-failure
Failure to notice or disarm the trap triggers 6 sharp spikes to spring out of the ground. PCs within 5 ft of the trap must succeed a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or take 5 (2d4+1) piercing damage.
```
```ad-success
On a successful Reflex save take **half damage** and **no damage** for a critical success.
```

```encounter
creatures:
- 3 Goblin Warrior 
- 1 Dib Halfling-Chewer
```
[[Dib Halfling-Chewer]] [[Goblin-Warrior]] 
### Rewards
```ad-success
title: Dib's Hidden Treasure 
A **DC 15 Perception check** reveals the seat of the throne is loose and offset
```
The throne hides Dib's treasure hoard. Inside the throne is a small wooden chest containing 60 sp, 15 gp and a scrap of paper with Dib's fortress design notes. **Award 10 XP**

```ad-tip
title: Bonus Clue 
The opposite side of Dib's illustrations is a manifest of the original cargo. This may include something incriminating for a local faction.
```
## Conclusion
No doubt the local authority is thankful the PCs removed the nuisance from the side of the road. What of the clan from which Dib and his entourage were expelled? How did the goblin develop such strong wrestling moves? Perhaps the entire clan practices unarmed combat; their desire to test their skills on civilized folk grows as the subterranean wrestling rings increase in number.
