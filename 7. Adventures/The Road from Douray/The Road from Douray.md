# Overview

An introductory adventure with about elvish culture, ecoterrorism. Designed to take characters from level 1 to level 2

The adventurers are a part of  a caravan to the new Union outpost of [[Rowan-Oak]]. Some may be hired on as part of the caravan guard. 
## Story
The party are all members of the very first trade "caravan" headed West from [[Douray]] towards [[Rowan-Oak]] carrying hardware and equipment for building fortifications as well as some farming equipment. The caravan master, [[Marcus]], is a dwarf trader who's trying to start selling flax grown from around Rowan-Oak, and the party are all either hired hands, guards or passengers associated with Marcus's cart. 

The second cart is entirely operated by the Union military. This includes two guards and a few hands as well as [[Governor Amara]] and her aide [[Nigel Crooner]]  who is going to visit the outpost with journalist [[Brenna McKenna]] to record the visit and convey the good that the Union is doing.

1. Players working with the caravan need to find [[Brenna McKenna]] before the parade starts.
2. Brenna is following up a lead at the local tavern about how union soldiers have been treating the locals as they pass through, interviewing the players who are passengers in the caravan.
  1. The tavern keeper, Reggie, has three kids and a big patterned rug in the center of the floor that they're all playing on. Other kids filter in and out and Reggie greets them.
3. When the players find her shes' a bit miffed but gets up to get ready, fussing with her bag and setting her notepad on the stool next to her.
4. A child secretly hired by the governor's aide, [[Nigel Crooner]] , dashes forward and snags the notebook. The players can stop this, catch the theif or lose the notebook. Doesn't really matter.
5. Everybody is just a little late but the Brenna makes it to the cart on time.
