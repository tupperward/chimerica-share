# The Fungal Crypt
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounters, Dungeon
**Setting**: Underground
**Encounter Type**: Investigative, Combat

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Read Aloud

The mausoleum opens and you descend into the waiting dark, it subterranean chill swallowing you whole. Your last glimpses of light reveal hewn granite walls with worn dwarven embellishments. The walls  occasionally give way to the loam and roots that surround it. In the dwarven tongue the term for someone a bit cracked which, literally translated, is that they "reek of dirt." This place literally reeks of dirt, a rich earthy... sometimes fleshy musk that pervades the skull like a saline nasal spray. 
```
```ad-note
title: Area Description

An ancient ruined hill dwarf mausoleum, taken over long ago by a colony of myconids.

The zombies in this area are animated not by undeath but the myconid colony, who are using them to defend against a band of kobolds that have taken shelter here after themselves being displaced.

Any creature that is not fungal gets spores on it the more they hit fungal creatures in this area. The more spores, the better the creature can communicate with the Myconids.

Four kobolds roast gigantic mushroom slices over a small glowing pile of stones, immitating a fire pit. They sit on ragged bedrolls and look like they haven't been here long. The rich aroma wafts over to where you watch them and your eyes follow the steam from the food as it traces a line past the staircase behind the creatures to the ceiling. A slightly better equipped kobold lays sleeping on a pile of detritis on the second level up the stairs.
