- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You gain the services of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys simple commands as best as it can. This trained animal is trained in [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of the skill listed for its type.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the animal trainer archetype.
