# Returned
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 51*  

You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [Diehard](../../feats/diehard.md) feat and the [Additional Lore](../../feats/additional-lore.md) feat for [Boneyard Lore](../../skills.md#Lore).
