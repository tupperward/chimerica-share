# Laborer
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

You've spent years performing arduous physical labor. It was a difficult life, but you somehow survived. You may have embraced adventuring as an easier method to make your way in the world, or you might adventure under someone else's command.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Labor Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Hefty Hauler](../../feats/hefty-hauler.md) skill feat in [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics).
