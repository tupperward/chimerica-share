# Saboteur
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 45*  

Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or structure's weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills or complete a particular mission.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) skill and the [Engineering Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Concealing Legerdemain](../../feats/concealing-legerdemain-apg.md) skill feat.
