# Osirionologist
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 58*  

Whether you're a fascinated outsider or a local proud of your nation's storied past, you're a devoted student of Osirion's history.

You might be a traveling professor, a member of a society like the Pathfinders or the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, or even a simple tomb robber cashing in on the glories of the past.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) skill and the [Ancient Osirion Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Oddity Identification](../../feats/oddity-identification.md) skill feat.
