# Final Blade Survivor
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 130*  

You fell prey to the whims of the Galtan mob and were scheduled for execution by final blade, but through skill—or sheer luck—you managed to talk your way out of it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) skill and the [Revolution Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Charming Liar](../../feats/charming-liar.md) skill feat.
