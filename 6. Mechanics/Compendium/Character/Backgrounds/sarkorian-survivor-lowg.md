# Sarkorian Survivor
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 34*  

The devastation and carnage of the Worldwound were nearly complete, but you somehow managed to survive it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Sarkorian History Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Forager](../../feats/forager.md) skill feat.
