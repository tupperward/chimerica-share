# Scout
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 64*  

You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and a [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as [Forest Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) or [Cavern Lore](../../skills.md#Lore)). You gain the [Forager](../../feats/forager.md) skill feat.
