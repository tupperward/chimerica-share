As a formally trained apothecary or a rural practitioner of folk medicine, you learned the healing properties of various herbs.

You're adept at collecting the right natural cures in all sorts of environments and preparing them properly.

You're trained in the [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Herbalism Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Natural Medicine](../../feats/natural-medicine.md) skill feat.
