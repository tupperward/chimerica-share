# Shadow Haunted
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 106*  

You are from Nidal, and regardless of your personal values, Zon-Kuthon has a claim on your soul due to an ancient pact. The Midnight Lord's unsettling influence is bred deep into your bones.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Shadow Plane Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Quick Coercion](../../feats/quick-coercion.md) skill feat.
