# Aspiring Free Captain
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

You seek to join the Free Captains of the Shackles and have learned everything you need to know about sailing and bossing people around. Now you just need a crew and a ship.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Sailing Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Group Coercion](../../feats/group-coercion.md) skill feat.
