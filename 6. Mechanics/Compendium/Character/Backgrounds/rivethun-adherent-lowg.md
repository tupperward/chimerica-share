# Rivethun Adherent
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 130*  

You have spent time learning the practices and traditions of the ancient Rivethun dwarven shamans and can recognize all sorts of magic. You may have chosen your own road since then, or you may remain an adherent of the philosophy.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) skill and the [Spirit Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Recognize Spell](../../feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
