# Gambler
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times due to your gambling and pursued adventuring as a way out of a spiral.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) skill and the [Games Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Lie to Me](../../feats/lie-to-me.md) skill feat.
