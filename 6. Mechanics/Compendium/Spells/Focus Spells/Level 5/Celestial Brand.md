A blazing symbol appears on the target, cursing it to face divine justice. You and your allies receive a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls and skill checks against it. Anytime a good creature damages it, the good creature deals an additional `dice: 1d4|avg` good damage. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
