You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible chill to your enemy. The target is cloaked in the freezing void, which deals `dice: 3d6|avg` cold damage immediately and the first time each round you Sustain the Spell on future turns, with a basic Fortitude save. The target is [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md) for as long as the effect persists.

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
