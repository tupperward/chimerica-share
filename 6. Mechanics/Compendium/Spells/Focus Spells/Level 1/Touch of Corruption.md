**Cast** ► somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 willing undead creature or 1 living creature

---
You infuse the target with negative energy. If the target is living, this deals `dice: 1d6|avg` negative damage (basic Fortitude save); on a failed save, the target also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage dealt to a living creature by `dice: 1d6|avg` or increase the Hit Points regained by undead by 6.
