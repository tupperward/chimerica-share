**Cast** â–º verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

---
You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) condition by 1, and whenever you would become frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. 
If you critically fail a save against fear, veil of confidence ends immediately, and you increase any frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
