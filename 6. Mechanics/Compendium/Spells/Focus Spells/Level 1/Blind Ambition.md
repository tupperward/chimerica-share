---
You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to its saving throws and other defenses against attempts to [coerce](../../../rules/actions/coerce.md) it, Request something of it, or use mental effects to convince it to do something (such as a [Suggestion](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%204/Suggestion.md) spell). This penalty applies only if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.

**Failure** As success, but the penalty is –2.

**Critical Failure** The target is overcome with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it.
