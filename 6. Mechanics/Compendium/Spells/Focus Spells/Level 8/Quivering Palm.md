**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Duration** 1 month

---
Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the [Auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) and [Concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

If you cast quivering palm again, the effects of any quivering palm you had previously cast end.

**Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Success** The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Failure** The target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by quivering palm.
**Critical Failure** The target dies.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
