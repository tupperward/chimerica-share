# Magic Starknives Trap *Hazard 5*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 22 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check to spot the magical energies reverberating in the pillars.  

Starknife symbols on the six pillars glow and shoot across the room.

- **Disable** DC 21 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (expert) or dispel magic on any four of the six pillars disables the entire trap (the trap is a 2nd-level spell and the DC to dispel it is 21). Destroying any four of the six pillars also disables the trap.
