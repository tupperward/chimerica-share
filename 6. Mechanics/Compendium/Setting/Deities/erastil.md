## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic p. 22*

Erastil favors those who commit themselves to their communities and detests those who disrupt these families.

- **Minor Boon** Erastil shares in his bounty as long as you work for it. Whenever you roll a critical failure at a check to [Subsist](../../../rules/actions/subsist.md) in the wild, you get a failure instead.
- **Moderate Boon**: You share Erastil's sharp eye, allowing you to use a [longbow](../../equipment/items/longbow.md) in any situation. When you attack with a [longbow](../../equipment/items/longbow.md), you can ignore the [longbow's](../../equipment/items/longbow.md) [volley](../../../rules/traits/volley.md) trait, and [longbows](../../equipment/items/longbow.md) have double the normal range increment for you.
- **Major Boon**: You become a friend to the land. You can cast [speak with plants](../../spells/speak-with-plants.md) as a [divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md) innate spell. When you are in a healthy natural environment, the land sustains you without need for food or drink. You can cast the [commune with nature](../../spells/rituals/commune-with-nature.md) ritual without any secondary casters or secondary checks.

- **Minor Curse**: Erastil curses your table and punishes you for relying on others' hard work. Any food you didn't grow, gather, or otherwise harvest yourself tastes like ash and leaves you [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
- **Moderate Curse** Erastil's beasts take a dislike to you. Animals' attitudes toward you are one category worse ([friendly](../../../rules/conditions.md#Friendly) instead of [helpful](../../../rules/conditions.md#Helpful), [indifferent](../../../rules/conditions.md#Indifferent) instead of [friendly](../../../rules/conditions.md#Friendly), and so on).
- **Major Curse**: Erastil leaves you unable to have children (or otherwise reproduce or propagate if you do so in a different manner). This curse also affects your livestock, pets, and crops.
