When a creature enters the snare's square, several strands of strong wires ending in jagged hooks latch onto it before hauling it to the ground. The snare deals `2d6` piercing damage, and the targeted creature must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) and [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round ([Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC 28).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [restrained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for 1 round ([Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC 28).
