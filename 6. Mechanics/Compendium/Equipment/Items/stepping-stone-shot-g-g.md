A series of small stone discs pressed into a single round make up this ammunition. When you fire an activated stepping stone shot, whether you hit or miss your target, the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any amount of weight, but don't otherwise pose any sort of obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use a two-action activity, which has the [manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to its speed on the stones while causing them to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in firearms with the [scatter](../../../rules/traits/scatter-g-g.md) trait. The maximum length of the line depends on the type of ammunition. However, the line also can't extend beyond the maximum distance for a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) from your firearm (usually six times the firearm's range increment).
