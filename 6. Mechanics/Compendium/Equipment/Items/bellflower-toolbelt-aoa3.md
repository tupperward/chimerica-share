# Bellflower Toolbelt *Item 6*  
[invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 220 gp
- **Usage** worn belt; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Worn

Different versions of this belt are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look somewhat different than a belt for baking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [V](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies")

You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. As long as there are enough transformed items, the belt can be used as artisan's tools for that trade.

Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to return it to its normal form.
