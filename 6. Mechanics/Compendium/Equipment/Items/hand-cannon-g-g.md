Popular among privateers and mercenaries in Goka, hand cannons are little more than a hardened tube with a handle and external ignition attached. A hand cannon can be used to fire almost anything that can be packed into its barrel. The wielder of a hand cannon can change the damage type granted by its [modular](../../../rules/traits/modular-logm.md) trait as part of the same [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action used to reload.
