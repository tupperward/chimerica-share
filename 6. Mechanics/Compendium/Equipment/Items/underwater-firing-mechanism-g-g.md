# Underwater Firing Mechanism *Item 9*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 600 gp
- **Usage** attached <to firearm (firing mechanism)>
- **Category** Firing Mechanism

This device replaces the attached firearm's normal firing mechanism (normally, most of the guns in this chapter use a flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm's wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark that's propelled through the firing mechanism and into the firearm, launching its bullet. An underwater firing mechanism allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of black powder. Attaching an underwater firing mechanism to a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.

Talismans A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (which is called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to that item. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently. The talismans included in this section are particularly useful for characters who wield firearms or crossbows.
