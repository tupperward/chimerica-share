This device has four finger-like latches centered around a whirring mass of gears.

After winding the clockwork rejuvenator, you can latch it to the chest of an adjacent recently dead creature and return it to life.

If you wound the rejuvenator using 1 [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action, you can return to life a creature that died in the last 2 rounds, restoring it to 1 HP. If you wound the rejuvenator using 2 [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions, you can return to life a creature that died within the last 3 rounds. After attaching, the device continues to whirl for 1 minute, restoring 10 HP per round to the target. Thereafter, the clockwork rejuvenator loses its magic and becomes inert.
