This arrowhead-shaped charm is not meant to be affixed to an arrow, but instead to be carried in a pocket or inside of a quiver. A hunter's arrowhead is etched with images sacred to the elven god [Ketephys](../../setting/deities/ketephys-logm.md). If you carry one on your person, you are infused with great skill at hunting, and gain a +1 item bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill checks and attack rolls against any creature you've currently designated as your prey for the [Hunt Prey](../../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) ranger ability (note that the bonus to attack rolls is an item bonus, and therefore not cumulative with an item bonus from a magic weapon). A hunter's arrowhead is also a religious symbol of [Ketephys](../../setting/deities/ketephys-logm.md).

This specific hunter's arrowhead (and no other) is a key to the Huntergate aiudara. If this hunter's arrowhead is touched to the stone within Huntergate, it activates the portal—provided the portal is fully functional. See "Cult of Cinders" for more information about Huntergate and what lies beyond its archway.
