An etheric essence disruptor emits bursts of discordant ethereal energy through a process based upon Stasian etheric-spirit singers, though without the need for a Stasian coil. Etheric essence disruptors attempt to break down the workings of a spell that manipulates spiritual essence. Upon activation, attempt to counteract an active [divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md) or [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md) spell within the listed range, with the listed counteract modifier and counteract level.
