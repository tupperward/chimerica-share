This band of interwoven gold and copper, traced with Aklo symbols, is topped with a gleaming, luminescent opal gently bleeding wisps of shadowstuff.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane [wish](../../../compendium/spells/wish.md) spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours. You are [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained), whether or not the ring refuses the wish.

Once the wish is cast, the Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the wish to the ring.
