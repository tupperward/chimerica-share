This travel-ready kit contains a small altar featuring a deity's iconography. The altar's top can be lifted to reveal a compartment for materials of no more than light Bulk (such as candles, incense, oils, and small texts). The altar grants a +1 item bonus to checks made to conduct religious rites using [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) or [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion).
