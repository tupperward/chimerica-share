This large crossbow has an internal chamber that can be loaded with up to five bolts. While it uses the same automated catch mechanism as other repeating crossbows, a repeating heavy crossbow's design has significant trade-offs. It has increased range and damage and is easier to learn how to use, but requires a small amount of effort to reload.
