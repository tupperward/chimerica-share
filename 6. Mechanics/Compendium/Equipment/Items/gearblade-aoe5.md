# Gearblade *Item 17*  
[clockwork](../../../rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Price** 13000 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 or 2 hands; **Bulk** 2
- **Category** Held

Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this +2 greater striking weapon can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the gearblade must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a [bastard sword](bastard-sword.md), [greatsword](greatsword.md), [longsword](longsword.md), or [shortsword](shortsword.md). It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the [disarm](../../../rules/traits/disarm.md) weapon trait and the versatile B weapon trait (which replaces any other [versatile](../../../rules/traits/versatile.md) trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the gearblade, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a [greatclub](greatclub.md).

- **Requirements**: You've wound the gearblade for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours

**Effect** The target's weapon is pulled through the gearblade's gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a DC 36 Reflex save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the gearblade, and the creature takes `3d12` bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure, they take `6d12` bludgeoning damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a [regenerate](../../../compendium/spells/regenerate.md) spell or a similar effect.
