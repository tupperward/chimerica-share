This peculiar rod is strange and unpredictable. Each time it is activated, it produces one of a variety of effects at random.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

Choose a creature within 60 feet and roll d% on the table below to determine the rod's effect. If an entry lists only a spell name, the rod casts that spell at its lowest level. You make any decisions for a spell cast by the rod unless otherwise indicated, except that it must target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.

Any spell DC required is DC 27, and any spell attack roll required is +17. If the rod casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or other defense against it.

Once activated, the rod can't be activated again for `1d4` hours.
