This sharp-taloned spiked gauntlet appears to have been crafted from dragon scales, with claws built from iron. In addition to the typical weapon traits, a Cinderclaw gauntlet has the versatile S trait.

On a critical hit, the Cinderclaw gauntlet deals an additional `1d6` fire damage.

- **Trigger**: Your attack roll with the Cinderclaw gauntlet is a critical success.

**Effect** The creature you hit must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) by the gauntlet's acrid smoke. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune.
