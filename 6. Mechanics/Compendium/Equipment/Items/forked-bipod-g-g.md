Developed by Alkenstar scouts who often don't have time to break down a tripod when beset by the chaotic mutant monsters of the Mana Wastes, this two-pronged stabbing weapon can be used as a bipod to stabilize a gun with potent kickback. A forked bipod can be deployed or retrieved for use as a melee weapon as an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action.
