This cute and unassuming dragon toy activates once a creature moves into its square. It then unleashes a rapid burst of toxic gas in a 10-foot emanation. Those within the emanation when the snare is activated must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take `3d6` poison damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
