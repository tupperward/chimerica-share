# Controlled Blast  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md); [Calculated Splash](calculated-splash.md), [Directional Bombs](directional-bombs.md), or [Expanded Splash](expanded-splash.md)

You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives by controlling every possible parameter of the blast meticulously. If you have the [Directional Bombs](directional-bombs.md) feats, you can use it with Set Explosives or Demolition Charge, even though you didn't throw the bombs. If you have the [Calculated Splash](calculated-splash.md) or [Expanded Splash](expanded-splash.md) feats, you can apply the additional splash damage to one of the bombs when you Set Explosives or use Demolition Charge, and you can apply the increased splash area from [Expanded Splash](expanded-splash.md) to all the bombs.
