# Quick Identification  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

You can [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you're a master, it takes a 3-action activity, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 action.
