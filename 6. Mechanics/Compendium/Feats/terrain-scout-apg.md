# Terrain Scout  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scout Dedication](scout-dedication-apg.md)

You gain the [Terrain Stalker](terrain-stalker.md) skill feat (Core Rulebook 267) twice, choosing a different terrain each time. If you [Avoid Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) while exploring and any allies use [Follow the Expert](../../rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) to follow you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.
