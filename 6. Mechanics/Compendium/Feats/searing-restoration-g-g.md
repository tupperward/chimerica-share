- **Activity** Single Action

They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were fools... Fools who didn't understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains `1d10` Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by `1d10`.

**Special.** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.
