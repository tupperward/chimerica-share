# Kobold Lore  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  


You attentively learned the key kobold survival strategies and mythology from your elders. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) and [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Kobold Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
