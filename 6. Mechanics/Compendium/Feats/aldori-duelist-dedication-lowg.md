# Aldori Duelist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from the [Broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) Lands region.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Aldori dueling swords](../equipment/items/aldori-dueling-sword-lowg.md)

Your Aldori duelist training teaches you martial techniques and increases your dedication to the Aldori dueling sword. You become trained in your choice of [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and in [Dueling Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

Whenever your proficiency rank in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency rank with [Aldori dueling swords](../equipment/items/aldori-dueling-sword-lowg.md). You gain access to [Aldori dueling swords](../equipment/items/aldori-dueling-sword-lowg.md).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Aldori duelist archetype.

## Aldori Duelist Dedication leads to...
