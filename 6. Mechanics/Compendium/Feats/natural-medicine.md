# Natural Medicine  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) instead of [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) to [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If you're in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) using [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), subject to the GM's determination.

## Natural Medicine leads to...

[Herbalist Dedication](herbalist-dedication-apg.md), [Endemic Herbs](endemic-herbs-apg.md), [Expert Herbalism](expert-herbalism-apg.md), [Fresh Ingredients](fresh-ingredients-apg.md), [Poultice Preparation](poultice-preparation-apg.md), [Gravelands Herbalist](gravelands-herbalist-lokl.md)
