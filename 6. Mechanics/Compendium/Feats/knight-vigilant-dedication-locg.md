# Knight Vigilant Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion), any good alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. You gain expert proficiency in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion). When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foe's attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Vigilant archetype.
