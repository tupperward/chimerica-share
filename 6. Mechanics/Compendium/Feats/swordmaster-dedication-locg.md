# Swordmaster Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution 14; member of the Pathfinder Society affiliated with the School of Swords

Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) you. If you have the [Deft Cooperation](deft-cooperation-lowg.md) feat and critically succeed on a check to [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) an ally's attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.
