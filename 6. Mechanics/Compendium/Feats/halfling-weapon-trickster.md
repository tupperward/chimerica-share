# Halfling Weapon Trickster  *Feat 5*  
[halfling](../../rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halfling Weapon Familiarity](halfling-weapon-familiarity.md)

You are particularly adept at fighting with your people's favored weapons. Whenever you critically succeed at an attack roll using a [shortsword](../equipment/items/shortsword.md), a [sling](../equipment/items/sling.md), or a halfling weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
