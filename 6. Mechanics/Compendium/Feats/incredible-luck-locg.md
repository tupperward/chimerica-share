# Incredible Luck  *Feat 13*  
[halfling](../../rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md)

Even other halflings consider you to be particularly lucky. You can use [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md) once per hour, rather than once per day. If you have [Guiding Luck](guiding-luck.md), you can still use [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md) when you fail a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check or attack roll only once per day (though you can use it within the same hour that you used [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md)), and if you have [Shared Luck](shared-luck-apg.md), you can still use [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md) on an ally instead of yourself only once per day.
