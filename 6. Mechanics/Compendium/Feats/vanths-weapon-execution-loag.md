# Vanth's Weapon Execution  *Feat 5*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vanth's Weapon Familiarity](vanths-weapon-familiarity-loag.md)

You've trained in the finer points of dealing death. Whenever you critically hit using a [bo staff](../equipment/items/bo-staff.md), [longbow](../equipment/items/longbow.md), [composite longbow](../equipment/items/composite-longbow.md), [scythe](../equipment/items/scythe.md), or [staff](../equipment/items/staff.md), you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
