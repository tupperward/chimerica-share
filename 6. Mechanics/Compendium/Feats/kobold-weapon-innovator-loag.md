# Kobold Weapon Innovator  *Feat 5*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Kobold Weapon Familiarity](kobold-weapon-familiarity-loag.md)

You've learned devious tactics with your kobold weapons. Whenever you critically hit with a [crossbow](../equipment/items/crossbow.md), [greatpick](../equipment/items/greatpick.md), [light pick](../equipment/items/light-pick.md), [pick](../equipment/items/pick.md), [spear](../equipment/items/spear.md), or kobold weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
