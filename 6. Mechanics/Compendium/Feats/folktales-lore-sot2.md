# Folktales Lore  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Folklorist Dedication](folklorist-dedication-sot2.md)

You can pull bits of wisdom from any tale. You become trained in [Folktales Lore](../skills.md#Lore), a special [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill that can be used only to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), but on any topic. If you fail a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with [Folktales Lore](../skills.md#Lore), you get the effects of the [Dubious Knowledge](dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat.

If you are legendary in the [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) skill, you gain expert proficiency in [Folktales Lore](../skills.md#Lore), but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [Folktales Lore](../skills.md#Lore) by any other means.
