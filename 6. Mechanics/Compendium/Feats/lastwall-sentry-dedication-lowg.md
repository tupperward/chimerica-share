# Lastwall Sentry Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from the Eye of Dread region.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Knights of Lastwall, [Shield Block](shield-block.md)

You've sworn yourself as a sentry for the Knights of Lastwall, the first line of defense against incursions by the Whispering Tyrant throughout Golarion. You become trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and in [Undead Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Finally, you gain the [Reactive Shield](reactive-shield.md) fighter feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype.
