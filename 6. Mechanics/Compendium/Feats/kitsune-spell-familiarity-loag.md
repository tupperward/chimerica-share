# Kitsune Spell Familiarity  *Feat 1*  
[kitsune](../../rules/traits/kitsune-loag.md)  


You've picked up a few magical tricks. During your daily preparations, choose [daze](../spells/daze.md), [forbidding ward](../spells/forbidding-ward.md), or [ghost sound](../spells/ghost-sound.md). Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
