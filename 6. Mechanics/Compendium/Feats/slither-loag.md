# Slither  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  


You are an expert at moving through extremely tight spaces. You gain the [Quick Squeeze](quick-squeeze.md) skill feat, even if you're not trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics). When you roll a success on an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Squeeze](../../rules/actions/squeeze.md), you get a critical success instead.
