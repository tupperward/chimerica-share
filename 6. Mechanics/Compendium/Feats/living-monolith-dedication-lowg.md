# Living Monolith Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from the Golden Road region.
- **Prerequisites**: Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. If you fail a recovery check while [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying), your [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition increases by only 1. You become trained in [Ancient Osirion Lore](../skills.md#Lore), or expert if you were already trained.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

## Living Monolith Dedication leads to...

[Ka Stone Ritual](ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md), [Attunement To Stone](attunement-to-stone-lowg.md), [Fortified Flesh](fortified-flesh-lowg.md), [Judgment Of The Monolith](judgment-of-the-monolith-lowg.md), [Stone Blood](stone-blood-lowg.md), [Stone Communion](stone-communion-lowg.md)
