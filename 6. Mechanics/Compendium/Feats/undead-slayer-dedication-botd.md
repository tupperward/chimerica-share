[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

Your training has prepared you to recognize most undead on sight. You become trained in two [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skills, each about a specific type of undead, or become an expert if you were already trained. You gain the Slayer's Identification free action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Slayer's Identification [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You roll initiative and can observe a creature you know is undead

**Effect** You attempt to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) to identify the undead creature with a +1 circumstance bonus. If you're a master in the skill you're using to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
