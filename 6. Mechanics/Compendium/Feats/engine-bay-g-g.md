# Engine Bay  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vehicle Mechanic Dedication](vehicle-mechanic-dedication-g-g.md), expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and can work on many machines at a time. When Repairing and spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If you are a master in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), you can fix up to four targets. If you're legendary in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), you can fix up to eight targets.

This feat has no effect when using [Quick Repair](quick-repair.md) or another ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
