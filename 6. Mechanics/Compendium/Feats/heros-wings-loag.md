# Hero's Wings  *Feat 17*  
[sprite](../../rules/traits/sprite-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Energize Wings](energize-wings-loag.md)

You have begun the final steps to reaching your full potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form without you needing to use Energize Wings, granting you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the [Glad-Hand](glad-hand.md) skill feat against other sprites, without taking a â€“5 penalty to your [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check.
