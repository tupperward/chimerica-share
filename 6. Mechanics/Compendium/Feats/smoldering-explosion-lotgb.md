[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [fireball](../spells/fireball.md)

While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [obscuring mist](../spells/obscuring-mist.md), except that it lasts only 1 round.
