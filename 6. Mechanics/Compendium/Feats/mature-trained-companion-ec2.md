# Mature Trained Companion  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Animal Trainer Dedication](animal-trainer-dedication-ec2.md)

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion. Increase its proficiency rank in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) to expert instead of one of the three skill increases for mature. It gains the Mesmerizing [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) advanced maneuver (see below), rather than the normal advanced maneuver for its type.

## Mature Trained Companion leads to...

[Splendid Companion](splendid-companion-ec2.md), [Specialized Companion](specialized-companion-ec2.md)
