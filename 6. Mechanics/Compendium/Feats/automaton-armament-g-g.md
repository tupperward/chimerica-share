You've been provided a body part designed for combat.

You gain either a claw or pincer unarmed attack. The claw deals `1d4` slashing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the agile, [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. The pincer deals `1d6` piercing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the [grapple](../../rules/traits/grapple.md) and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.
