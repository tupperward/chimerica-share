[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)

You attempt a death-defying maneuver to distract your enemies. Select one foe within reach and attempt either an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against your target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, you can [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to half your Speed (or up to your full Speed if you critically succeed) without triggering reactions from the target due to your movement, and the target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your turn.

## Daring Act leads to...
