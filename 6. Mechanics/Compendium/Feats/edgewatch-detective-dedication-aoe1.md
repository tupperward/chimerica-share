# Edgewatch Detective Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 14 or Wisdom 14

You become trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) or [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery); if you are already trained in both of these skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) instead of [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) to [Track](../../rules/actions/track.md), and you gain the [Experienced Tracker](experienced-tracker.md) skill feat (Core Rulebook 261).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the this archetype.

## Edgewatch Detective Dedication leads to...

[Arcane Sensitivity](arcane-sensitivity-aoe1.md), [Bolera's Interrogation](boleras-interrogation-aoe1.md), [Sense Alignment](sense-alignment-aoe1.md)
