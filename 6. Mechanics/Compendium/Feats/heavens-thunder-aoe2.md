# Heaven's Thunder  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  verbal  

- **Prerequisites**: [Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication](jalmeri-heavenseeker-dedication-aoe2.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With a loud shout, you unleash your ki in a crackling shroud of thunder and lightning that engulfs your body.

Until the end of your next turn, your unarmed attacks and weapons you wield that have the [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md) trait deal additional electricity damage equal to one-half your level and additional sonic damage equal to one-half your level.

If you also know the [ki blast](../spells/ki-blast.md) ki spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force while this effect is active (ki blast loses the [force](../../rules/traits/force.md) trait and gains the [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md) or [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md) trait instead). Any creature who successfully Grapples you or is successfully Grappled by you also takes this damage immediately after the [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md) check is resolved.
