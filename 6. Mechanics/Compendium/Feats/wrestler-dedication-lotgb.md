# Wrestler Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), unarmed attacks, and unarmored defense

Your training in the wrestling arts has made you particularly adept at moving, striking, and grappling while unencumbered.

You become an expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and gain the [Titan Wrestler](titan-wrestler.md) skill feat. You don't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude DC when resisting an opponent's attempts to [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md) you or Swallow you Whole.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wrestler archetype.
