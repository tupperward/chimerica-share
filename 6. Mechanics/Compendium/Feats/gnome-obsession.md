# Gnome Obsession  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](../../rules/traits/gnome.md)  


You might have a flighty nature, but when a topic captures your attention, you dive into it headfirst. Pick a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the trained proficiency rank in that skill. At 2nd level, you gain expert proficiency in the chosen [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) as well as the [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) granted by your background, if any. At 7th level you gain master proficiency in these [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skills, and at 15th level you gain legendary proficiency in them.
