# Anarchic Arcana  *Feat 9*  
[ganzi](../../rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md)  


The magic in your blood is unpredictable. When you make your daily preparations, roll `1d12` twice and consult the following list. 1: [acid arrow](../spells/acid-arrow.md); 2: [blur](../spells/blur.md); 3: [hideous laughter](../spells/hideous-laughter.md); 4: [humanoid form](../spells/humanoid-form.md); 5: [illusory object](../spells/illusory-object.md); 6: [mirror image](../spells/mirror-image.md); 7: [resist energy](../spells/resist-energy.md); 8: [see invisibility](../spells/see-invisibility.md); 9: [shatter](../spells/shatter.md); 10: [sound burst](../spells/sound-burst.md); 11: [spider climb](../spells/spider-climb.md); 12: [telekinetic maneuver](../spells/telekinetic-maneuver.md). You can cast each of those two spells once during the following day (or one spell twice if you rolled doubles) as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
