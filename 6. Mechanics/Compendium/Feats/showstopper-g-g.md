# Showstopper  *Feat 14*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Twirl](pistol-twirl-g-g.md), master in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that's difficult to look away from.

When using Pistol Twirl to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md), you can target all enemies within your weapon's first range increment who you can perceive and who can see you. You roll one [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check and compare it against each target's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC.
