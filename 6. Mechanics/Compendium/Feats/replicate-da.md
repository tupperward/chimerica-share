# Replicate  *Feat 5*  
[reflection](../../rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clone-Risen](clone-risen-da.md)

You've learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md) once per day as an innate occult spell. This is a [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md) and [morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md) effect, as your body physically transforms, rather than an [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md) effect.
