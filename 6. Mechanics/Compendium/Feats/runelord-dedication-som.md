# Runelord Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [class](../../rules/traits/class-som.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: runelord specialization

Your rune magic increases, and you practice with your school's associated weapon. You gain an additional cantrip of your chosen arcane school, and each time you gain a level (including this level), you add an additional spell from your chosen arcane school to your spellbook, with the same restrictions as the two spells you normally add.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the runelord archetype.
