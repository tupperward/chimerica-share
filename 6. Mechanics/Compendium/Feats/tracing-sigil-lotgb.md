# Tracing Sigil  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [sigil](../spells/sigil.md)

When you cast [sigil](../spells/sigil.md), you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to [Track](../../rules/actions/track.md) the target, substituting an [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your [sigil](../spells/sigil.md) spell) for the [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check. Much like [Tracking](../../rules/actions/track.md) with [Survival](../skills.md#Survival), this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the [sigil](../spells/sigil.md) spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.

## Tracing Sigil leads to...
