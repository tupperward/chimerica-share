# Reverse Engineer  *Feat 2*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You are incredibly skilled at reverse engineering items to learn their formulas, or disassembling them just to disable them. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) checks to reverse engineer a formula from an item. If you get a critical success on your [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) check, you can opt to both create the formula and reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item's value. Furthermore, you can use [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) instead of [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) to [Disable a Device](../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) or [Pick a Lock](../../rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md).
