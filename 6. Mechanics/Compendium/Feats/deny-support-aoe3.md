# Deny Support  *Feat 10*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival

When you succeed or critically succeed at a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) an opponent, that target can't flank with their allies until the beginning of your next turn.
