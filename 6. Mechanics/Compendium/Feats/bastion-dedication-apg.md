# Bastion Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](shield-block.md)

You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You gain the [Reactive Shield](reactive-shield.md) fighter feat.

This fulfills any prerequisites requiring [Reactive Shield](reactive-shield.md) as normal.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bastion archetype.

## Bastion Dedication leads to...

[Destructive Block](destructive-block-apg.md), [Disarming Block](disarming-block-apg.md), [Nimble Shield Hand](nimble-shield-hand-apg.md), [Shield Salvation](shield-salvation-apg.md), [Drive Back](drive-back-lokl.md)
