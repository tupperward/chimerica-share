# Scout Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [Scout's Warning (ranger)](scouts-warning-ranger.md) ranger feat. When you're using the [Scout](../../rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.

## Scout Dedication leads to...

[Fleeting Shadow](fleeting-shadow-apg.md), [Scout's Charge](scouts-charge-apg.md), [Scout's Pounce](scouts-pounce-apg.md), [Scout's Speed](scouts-speed-apg.md), [Terrain Scout](terrain-scout-apg.md), [Eclipsed Vitality](eclipsed-vitality-lokl.md)
