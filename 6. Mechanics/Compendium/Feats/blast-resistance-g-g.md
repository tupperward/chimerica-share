# Blast Resistance  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You're used to the clamor of steel, the crack of a firearm, and the thunderous blast of explosions. You gain resistance 3 to sonic. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) effect that causes the [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) condition, you get a critical success instead.
