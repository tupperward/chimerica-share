# Red Mantis Assassin Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Mediogalti Island.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in sawtooth sabers, deity is [Achaekek](../setting/deities/achaekek-logm.md), lawful evil alignment, member of the Red Mantis assassins

You have learned how to stalk your foes and slay them with a sawtooth sabre. You become trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) and [Assassin Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency with sawtooth sabers.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Red Mantis assassin archetype.
