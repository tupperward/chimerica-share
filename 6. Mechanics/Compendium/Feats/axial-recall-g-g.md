# Axial Recall  *Feat 17*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast [plane shift](../spells/plane-shift.md) twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.
