# Automaton Lore  *Feat 1*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  


You have come to better understand the process that made your body and the magic that powers it. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) and [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Automaton Lore](../skills.md#Lore).

**Enhancement** Your gain greater understanding. Increase your proficiency rank in either [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) or [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), as well as [Automaton Lore](../skills.md#Lore), to expert. If you were already an expert in the chosen skill, increase your rank to master instead.
