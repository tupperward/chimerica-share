# Modular  
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic p. 120*  

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an [Interact](../actions/interact.md) action. This typically changes the type of damage the weapon deals (listed in the trait, such as "modular B, P, or S"). However, it can also change the weapon's traits. For example, a [switchscythe's](../../compendium/equipment/items/switchscythe-lotgb.md) "modular (P and [grapple](grapple.md), or S and [sweep](sweep.md))" means that the [switchscythe](../../compendium/equipment/items/switchscythe-lotgb.md) can either deal piercing damage and gain the [grapple](grapple.md) trait, or it can deal slashing damage and gain the [sweep](sweep.md) trait.
