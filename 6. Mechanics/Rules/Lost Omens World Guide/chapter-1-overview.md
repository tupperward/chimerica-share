> 
> ### TIME
> <sup>LOWG p. 9</sup>
> 
> Like Earth, Golarion spins on its axis once roughly every 24 hours. A week has 7 days and a year has 52 weeks. To keep the calendar synchronized with the astronomical year, an extra leap day is tacked on to the second month of the year every 4 years.
> 
> ### MONTHS AND DAYS
> <sup>LOWG p. 9</sup>
> 
> The names of the months of the year are as follows in the Inner Sea region:
> 
> Abadius (January)
> 
> Calistril (February)
> 
> Pharast (March)
> 
> Gozran (April)
>

> ### ACCESS TO RULES ELEMENTS
> <sup>LOWG p. 10</sup>
> 
> Sometimes, a stat block for an uncommon rules element might include a bold Access entry that lists specific criteria. A character who meets the criteria listed in the Access entry, often hailing from a particular locale or being a member of a particular organization, gains access to the rules element. For instance, a character from Taldor gains access to the Lion Blade archetype, even though it's uncommon.
> 
> ### ARCHETYPES
> <sup>LOWG p. 10</sup>
> 
> Applying the archetypes provided in this book requires you to select archetype feats instead of class feats. Once you have the archetype's dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it replaces. Archetype feats you gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.
> 
> Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter Resiliency archetype feat).
> 
> Each archetype's dedication feat represents a certain portion of your character's time and focus, so once you select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy its requirements before you can gain another dedication feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype's list. You cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.
> 
> Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another feat. You must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way.

Heroes aren't born, they're forged: forced by extraordinary circumstances to rise above and shaped by the world they inhabit.

This book is a guide to that world. In its pages, you'll learn about the heart of the Pathfinder setting, known as the Inner Sea region, from the towns and cities your heroes call home to the wild frontiers and monstrous lairs where they'll risk everything in search of fortune and glory. The information presented here provides players with a sense of the setting as a whole and is perfect for both fleshing out existing character concepts and inspiring you when you're not sure what to play. Is your wizard a necromancer from haunted Ustalav, raised to battle the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant, or a young student at the Arcanamirium in Absalom, the City at the Center of the World? Perhaps you're a daring priest from the burning deserts of Qadira, blasting manticores and genies with the blazing light of the sun goddess Sarenrae, or a troll-hunting warrior from the icy Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Regardless, here you'll find the rich details you need to give your character the perfect backstory, as well as new backgrounds, gods, feats, spells, and other rules to help you customize your ideal hero.

Likewise, Game Masters will find a rich and exciting world filled with hundreds of inspiring characters, plots, and adventure locations to get their creativity flowing, as well as new gear and magical items to reward their band of adventurers. Will you take your group to the rugged land of Numeria in search of alien technology from a crashed spaceship? Might they fight devils in diabolical Cheliax, or instead ally with the denizens of Hell themselves to reforge a troubled empire? They could venture into the ancient pyramids of Osirion, where mummies guard magic from a lost age, or battle dragons in the fractious orc hold of Belkzen. Whether you want your party to face pirates or giants, elves or dwarves, vampires or sphinxes, there's no end to the threats and treasures lurking in the ruins of lost empires, in temples to forgotten godsâ€”or just beyond their campfire's light.

The Inner Sea awaits. Are you ready?

## The World of Golarion
<sup>LOWG p. 6</sup>

While the multiverse is a big place, most Pathfinder adventures take place on Golarion: a planet of magic and mystery, where mortal heroes can ascend to godhood and terrifying monsters threaten entire civilizations. This book focuses on the Inner Sea region, the traditional heart of the Pathfinder campaign setting, which consists of the entire continent of Avistan and the northern third of the continent of Garund directly to the south. Yet Golarion is much larger than any one nation or continent, and adventurers from the Inner Sea may travel far and wide in pursuit of greatness. Below is a brief overview of Golarion's different major regions.
