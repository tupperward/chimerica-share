*Source: Guns & Gears p. 110*  

**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Sniper
- **Activity**: Two-Action

Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md). If the target is [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed), the [Strike](strike.md) deals an extra die of weapon damage, and the foe takes [persistent bleed damage](../conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the amount of precision damage from your [One Shot, One Kill](one-shot-one-kill-g-g.md).
