# Act Together [V](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies")
[summoner](../traits/summoner-som.md)  [tandem](../traits/tandem-som.md)  
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 53*  

**Class** summoner
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity**: Varies ([>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action"))

You and your eidolon act as one. Either you or your eidolon takes an action or activity using the same number of actions as Act Together, and the other takes a single action.

For example, if you spent 2 actions to Act Together, you could cast [burning hands](../../compendium/spells/burning-hands.md) (2 actions) and your eidolon could [Strike](strike.md) (1 action), or your eidolon could use its Breath Weapon (2 actions) and you could [Stride](stride.md) (1 action).

This lets you each use separate exploration activities like [Avoid Notice](avoid-notice.md) as you travel (Core Rulebook 496).
