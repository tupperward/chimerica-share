- **Activity**: Two-Action

Should foes parry your blade or dodge your bullets? Neither—they should be watching their purse. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) with your combination weapon, and then attempt a [Thievery](../../compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check with a –5 penalty to [Steal](steal.md) from your target; you can't [Steal](steal.md) closely guarded objects or objects that would take a long time to pilfer. You don't need a free hand to attempt to [Steal](steal.md) something in this manner. If your [Thievery](../../compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check succeeds, the target is [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, and you don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack. These effects occur even if your target has no objects to [Steal](steal.md).
