You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a [Diplomacy](../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

> - **Success** As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
