*Source: Guns & Gears p. 142*  

**Archetype** [Unexpected Sharpshooter](../../compendium/character/archetypes/unexpected-sharpshooter-g-g.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You make a [Strike](strike.md) with a ranged weapon, rolling the attack and damage twice and using the better results for each. The attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being [concealed](../conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden).
