You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while reloading to make your next attack. Either [Take Cover](take-cover.md) or attempt to [Hide](hide.md), then [Interact](interact.md) to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to [Take Cover](take-cover.md) or [Hide](hide.md); you must be [prone](../conditions.md#Prone), benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to [Take Cover](take-cover.md), and you need to be benefiting from cover or [concealed](../conditions.md#Concealed) to a creature to [Hide](hide.md) from that creature.
