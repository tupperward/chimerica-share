# Sneak (basic) [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[move](../traits/move.md)  [secret](../traits/secret.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 252*  

**Skill** [stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

You can attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected). [Stride](stride.md) up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while [Burrowing](burrow.md), [Climbing](climb.md), [Flying](fly.md), or [Swimming](swim.md) instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type; you must move at half that Speed.)

If you're [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) by a creature and it's impossible for that creature to observe you (for a typical creature, this includes when you're [invisible](../conditions.md#Invisible), the observer is [blinded](../conditions.md#Blinded), or you're in darkness and the creature can't see in darkness), for any critical failure you roll on a check to Sneak, you get a failure instead. You also continue to be [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) if you lose cover or greater cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature. At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check in secret and compares the result to the [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC of each creature you were [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) by at the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater cover from the creature throughout your [Stride](stride.md), you gain the +2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover) to your [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check. Because you're moving, the bonus increase from [Taking Cover](take-cover.md) doesn't apply. You don't get to roll against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither are concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against it. You automatically become [observed](../conditions.md#Observed) by such a creature.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You're [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) by the creature during your movement and remain [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) by the creature at the end of it.
>
>    If you successfully become [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) to a creature but then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be concealed from it, you become [observed](../conditions.md#Observed) again. You cease being [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) if you do anything except [Hide](hide.md), Sneak, or [Step](step.md). If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed) against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become [observed](../conditions.md#Observed) just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check.
>
>    If a creature uses [Seek](seek.md) to make you [observed](../conditions.md#Observed) by it, you must successfully [Hide](hide.md) to become [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from it again.
> - **Failure** A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away, though you still remain unseen. You're [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from the creature throughout your movement and remain so.
> - **Critical Failure** You're spotted! You're observed by the creature throughout your movement and remain so. If you're [invisible](../conditions.md#Invisible) and were [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from the creature, instead of being [observed](../conditions.md#Observed) you're [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) throughout your movement and remain so.
