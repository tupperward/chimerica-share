# Flurry of Blows [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[flourish](../traits/flourish.md)  [monk](../traits/monk.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 156*  

**Class** monk
- **Activity**: Single Action

Make two unarmed [Strikes](strike.md). If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the [Strikes](strike.md) normally. As it has the [flourish](../traits/flourish.md) trait, you can use [Flurry of Blows](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) only once per turn.
