**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Sniper
- **Activity**: Single Action

Make a firearm or crossbow [Strike](strike.md). If you're [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) by the target, the [Strike](strike.md) adds the additional precision damage from One Shot, One Kill; if you would already receive that additional damage on the [Strike](strike.md), the effects aren't cumulative. If you were [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected) or [unnoticed](../conditions.md#Unnoticed) by any creatures, you're now [hidden](../conditions.md#Hidden) from them instead, as the origin of the attack is clear.
