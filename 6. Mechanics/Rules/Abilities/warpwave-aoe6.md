# Warpwave

Many proteans can inflict disorienting alterations in time and space called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll `1d8` and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for `1d4` rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.
