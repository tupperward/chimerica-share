The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to [Demoralize](../actions/demoralize.md) each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then.
