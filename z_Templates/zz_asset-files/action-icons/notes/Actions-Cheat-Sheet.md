If you’re a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you’re legendary, it’s +4 Crit. Fail: -1 circumstance penalty to their check. Must pass a check set by the GM, Base DC 20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |

| [Delay](delay.md) *⭓{ .Pathfinder }*                   | At the start of your turn, after suffering [Persistent Damage](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Persistent%20Damage) and ending any effects that should end, you can decide to [Delay](delay.md) your turn until later in the round. You can re-enter the initiative order at the end of any other creature’s turn, permanently establishing your initiative at that point in the round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |

Crit: You are free and can stride 5ft. Crit. Fail: You don’t get free, and you can’t attempt again until next turn.                                                                                                                                   |     |

If the trigger occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it). If you [Ready](ready.md) an attack, and that attack would have a multiple attack penalty if it were made on your turn, the penalty still applies during your reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |

If you want to Release something outside of turn, use [Ready](ready.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

The GM makes a secret [Perception](TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Perception) check vs. Stealth DCs of hidden creatures or objects in that area. Success: One or more hidden creatures’ or objects’ position is revealed. Otherwise, the GM will not specify.                                                                              |     |
