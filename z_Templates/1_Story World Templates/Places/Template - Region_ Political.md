Take this entire page as a prompt, flesh out the missing details and output the same page with those details. Anything populated with "Placeholder" needs elaboration. Any list needs to be fleshed out as well, replacing its numbered entry with an entry corresponding to its category. Do not create more categories, do not create more list  items. If your are prompted to select something from a list and elaborate, do so but only for that category.
