**[Agile](../rules/traits/agile.md):** The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is reduced to –4 instead of –5, and – 8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

**[Backstabber](../rules/traits/backstabber.md):** When you hit a [Flat-Footed](../rules/conditions.md#Flat-Footed) creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. 

**[Deadly](../rules/traits/deadly.md):** On a critical hit, the weapon adds a die of the listed size.

**[Disarm](../rules/traits/disarm.md):** You can use this weapon to [Disarm](../rules/traits/disarm.md) with the Athletics skill even if you do not have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach and adds the weapon’s item bonus. If you fumble a check to [Disarm](../rules/traits/disarm.md) with the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat it as a normal failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

**[Finesse](../rules/traits/finesse.md):** You can choose to use Dexterity instead of Strength on attack rolls. Damage rolls still use Strength.

**[Forceful](../rules/traits/forceful.md):** This weapon becomes more dangerous when you build up momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon dice and each attack after that adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon dice.

**[Propulsive](../rules/traits/propulsive.md):** You can add 1/2 your Strength modifier on damage rolls with a [Propulsive](../rules/traits/propulsive.md) ranged weapon.

**[Splash](../rules/traits/splash.md):** When you use a [Thrown](../rules/traits/thrown.md) weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.

**[Sweep](../rules/traits/sweep.md):** This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your attack roll if you already attempted an attack this turn against a different creature from your target.

**[Thrown](../rules/traits/thrown.md):** You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A [Thrown](../rules/traits/thrown.md) weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

**[Two-Hand](../rules/traits/two-hand.md):** This weapon can be wielded with two hands. This changes its damage die to the indicated value.

**[Versatile](../rules/traits/versatile.md):** A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternate damage type listed. For instance, a piercing weapon that has “versatile S” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack.
